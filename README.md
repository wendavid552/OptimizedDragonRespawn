## Optimized Dragon Respawn
## Description
This mod aims to remove lag from dragon respawn in vanilla minecraft (Though most of minecraft player do not feel about that lag).

Now this mod could help reduce the lag of an endstone farm from ~300mspt to ~10mspt, without affecting vanilla feature. Since such lag in vanilla is unacceptable, this mod is kind of essential in 1.18+.
